 * Example: export const attachTitle = (arg) => {<Your_code>}

 * @task
 * Create a function that follows the requirements:
 * * Returns a fulfilled promise with a value of `'MANHATTAN'`.
 * * Build a promise chain off the promise we just constructed that first calls `attachTitle` then calls `console.log`.
 * If your program runs successfully, it should print out and return “DR. MANHATTAN” which is extremely exciting.

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-5"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
